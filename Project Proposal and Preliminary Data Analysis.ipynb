    "Thanks to the internet and the rise of internet message boards to the wider public such as Reddit, 4chan and not Newsgroups, the past 5 years have never been a better time for fans of pop-culture and interest groups to connect with one another. However, despite the internet being interconnected and everything out in the open, there is still the tendency for groups of people to clump up or join the same set of groups (which is still clumping up).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the investigation is to see what percentage of users belong to which fandoms, and how different fandoms overlap or avoid each other. For example: Do Digimon fans also interact with those who also like Pokémon, and vice versa<sup>[1]</sup>?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gather the data, first, uses are aggregated and posts are scraped of Reddit using the Reddit API<sup>[2]</sup>. Using the raw post data of [parent, user, score, subreddit, content], we can then clean it into a machine-usable state by using text analysis to build our database of data points. Before processing, we can already see content by their authors, communities posted to and upvotes. From there, we can look at the comments to see what is being mentioned where. Keywords, for example such as Pokémon names can be used to signify that a person knows about, well, Pokémon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work out how likely a person from a fandom is part or knows about another, we can emply methods such as k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines to class users into their fandoms, and, to work out (theatrically) where new users may sit within the multi-dimensions of different fandoms. \n"
