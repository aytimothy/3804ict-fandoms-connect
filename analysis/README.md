# 3804ICT Data Mining Assignment

The algorithm used to find out the data is done three times;

* `framework.py` uses `mlxtend`,
* `scratch.py` is written from scratch, and
* `weka.py` tells you to open the attached Weka Project in Weka.

Finally, `common.py` just contains common code between `framework.py` and `scratch.py`.  
... and `setup.py` does what it says on the tin.
